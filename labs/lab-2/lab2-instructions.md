# Lab 2: Back-end

The goal of this lab exercise is to practice what you've learned about Postgres, Node.js, and Express.

## Prerequisites

1. If you haven't done so, go through [Local Development Setup](../local-dev-setup.md)
2. Lab 1 must be completed before starting this lab.
3. Checkout 'lab-1/<your-group-name>/cart-page' branch in your local repository. If you are not on that branch, run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   git checkout lab-1/<your-group-name>/cart-page
   ```
4. Create a new branch and name it `lab-1/<your-group-name>/discounts`â€‹. In VS Code, you can do this by opening the terminal and running:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b lab-1/<your-group-name>/discounts
   ```

## Objective: Add a feature to the website for product discounts.

It should:

1. Display the discount percentage for each product in the product page as well as the final price after applying the discount.
2. When a user adds a product to the cart, it should apply the discount if available.

### Milestone 1. Add a new table to the buildagarden database for storing discount data on products

1. Create the table
   Table Name: `discounts`
   Columns:

   - `id` (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
   - `product_id` (int)
   - `name` (String)
   - `discount_percentage` (Float)

     **Hint: You can use the query in the [db_setup.md](../../docs/db-setup.md) file as a reference for creating the table.**

2. Insert the following data into the `discounts` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO discounts (product_id, name, discount_percentage) VALUES
(1, 'Spring Sale', 20),
(6, 'Oak Tree Discount', 15);
```

### Milestone 2. Add a new 'api/discounts' route to server.js for fetching discount data

**Hint: You can use the existing 'api/products' route in `server.js` as a reference for creating the new route.**

### Milestone 3. Add a new action in the Products store for fetching all discount data

1. Open the `stores/products.js` file and add a new action to call the 'api/discounts' endpoint to fetch all discount data.
   **HINT: Make sure to initialize `discounts` to an empty array in the state.**

2. Modify `App.vue` to call the new action when the app is mounted.

### Milestone 4. Test your changes

1. Add a new discount for the Rose product with a 50% discount. Connect to the database using pgAdmin and run this query on the `buildagarden` database:

```sql
INSERT INTO discounts (product_id, name, discount_percentage) VALUES
(2, 'Rose Discount', 50);
```

2. Go to the flowers page and confirm that the Rose product now shows a 50% discount and the final price after applying the discount.

- Rose - Quantity 1
- Oak Tree - Quanitity 1

Navigate to the cart page and it should look something like this:

### Milestone 5. Create a pull request of your changes

1. Commit your changes to the branch

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add discounts feature"
   ```

2. Push the branch to the remote repository

   ```
   git push origin lab-1/<your-group-name>/discounts
   ```

3. Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of the repository
